git add . ;git commit -m "some msg" ;git push -u origin main


ansible is developed from python and it is push based, recently it also acts like pull based.


disadvantages of shell script:
------------------------------
disadvantages
--------------
1. no idempotency
2. no error handling
3. Hard to understand
4. Homogeneous --> means only works for one distro
5. not scalable
6. imperative type of programming


configuration management
----------------
server should be ready with application

install application runtime
install system packages
install application dependencies
download the code
create users, permissions, directories
create systemctl services
In ansible while installing packages ," package "module is used for heterogenous, but in complanies user similar platform across all applications so better to use "dnf" module for rhel servers.

CM tools --> puppet, chef --> old. Ansible is new
ansible runs on ssh protocol

Types of markup languages:
------------------------
HTML --> Hyper text markup language
YAML --> Yet another markup language
XML --> extensive markup language


data over internet is tranfereeed with concept of DTO --> data transfer objects, in json or xml formats.

XML format:
--------------
<Students>
	<Student>
		<Name>Sivakumar</Name>
		<DOB>2020-01-01</DOB>
		<Addresses>
			<PermAddress>
				<AddressLine1>D-203</AddressLine1
				<AddressLine2>Sai Apartments</AddressLine2>
				<Stree>Gandi Nagar</Street>
			</PermAddress>
			<CurrentAddress>
				<AddressLine1>D-203</AddressLine1
				<AddressLine2>Sai Apartments</AddressLine2>
				<Stree>Gandi Nagar</Street>
			</CurrentAddress>		
		</Addresses>
	</Student>
	<Student>
		<Name>Sivakumar</Name>
		<DOB>2020-01-01</DOB>
		<Addresses>

JSON --> Java script object notation
-----------------------------------
{
	"Username": "sivakumar",
	"Password": "admin123",
	"DoorNo": 123
}


{
	"name": "sivakumar",
	"dob": "2020-01-01",
	"address": "D-203, Gandhi Nagar, Bang"
}

[] --> denotes list
{} --> map/dictionary

{
	"name": "sivakumar",
	"dob": "2020-01-01",
	"address": [
		{
			"addressline-1": "D-203",
			"addressline-2": "gandhi nagar",
			"city": "bang"
		},
		{
			"addressline-1": "D-203",
			"addressline-2": "gandhi nagar",
			"city": "bang"
		}
	]
}


YAML --> Yet another markup language
-------------------------------------
based on indentation
